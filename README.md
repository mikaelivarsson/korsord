# korsord
Create the words part of swedish crosswords.
I use it together with inkscape to adjust details and add images before exporting to pdf.

run with:
```
python korsord.py <inputfile.txt>
```
this will create <inputfile>.svg and <inputfile_facit>.svg. _facit contains the solution as well, the ordinary .svg only contains the clues and decorations.

see example helper.txt, help_facit.svg and helper.svg for available input commands.
For a proper example of a complete crossword see pumpkryss_1*

To look correct the font https://font.download/font/dom-casual-d should be installed on your system.
